# closestPairs

Recursive divide and conquer implementation for finding closes pair of points in Euclidean plane

#### RUN:

\> 'python closest_pair_of_points.py' 

#### NOTE:

If default system interpreter is Python2, program will throw error.
Python3 should be specified if not system default.

Input files are hard-coded into .py file. Program will execute automatically only if 
source files are located in same directory.

#### EXPECTED OUTPUT:

The minimum distance in 10points.txt is:
947.4054042489: (511, 4721)<--->(1267, 5292)

The minimum distance in 100points.txt is:
90.4433524368: (1730, 3258)<--->(1758, 3344)

The minimum distance in 1000points.txt is:
47.8539444560: (42980, 10593)<--->(42989, 10546)
